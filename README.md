# My Reasoning for Creating This Pack

I've built quite a few modpacks at this point (on and off of CurseForge), and I can never remember which mods to include and which performance mods conflicted with each other. So, instead of looking around and rebuilding the "core" of the pack over and over, I've decided to create this pack.

## Notes

This pack does not include any quality of life enhancements or bugfixes, as those may alter gameplay in unforeseen ways depending on how your pack is structured. This includes any Optifine/Optifine-parity mods that do not directly contribute to performance. If you are looking for an out of the box Optifine/Iris pack I'd suggest taking a look at [Fabulously Optimized](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/fabulously-optimized).
Additionaly, this pack would not be possible without [The Useful Lists, Useful Mods git repo](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods).

## The End Goal

I aim to simplify the creation of good modpacks/servers, while also saving myself time. This includes packs for Fabric/Forge (and hopefully Quilt), with both client and server variants of the pack, from 1.8.8 to 1.19.2.
The main focus is going to be on recent versions + modding API milestones, that way I can knock out the more used versions first.

## How to Implement This Pack

### Optimizing Vanilla Gameplay

This pack should be ready out of the box to optimize your game. As mentioned previously you'll need to install your own Shaders, Resource packs, and quality of life mods. You will also need to install Optifine manually, as the mod is not allowed in CurseForge packs.

### In Your Own Pack

Just download the files and go nuts, and most importantly: test for compatibility a few mods at a time. If you find an incompatible mod, report it to the git repo with pack MC version, Mod loader, and Modpack Version and which mods are conflicting (I am not going to trial/error your whole modpack for you). We can then add that mod to the list of known conflicts.

### Manually Add it to a Pre-Made Pack

Same as before, test a few mods at a time, and if you find an incompatible mod, report it to the git repo with pack MC version, Mod loader, and Modpack Version and which mods are conflicting (I am not going to trial/error the whole modpack for you). We can then add that pack to the list of known conflicts, and list whatever solution is available.

## And ultimately, thank you to all the mod creators who have made this pack possible!
